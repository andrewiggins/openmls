//! # The OpenMLS Delivery Service (DS).
//!
//! This is a minimal implementation of 2.3. Delivery Service in
//! [The MLS Architecture](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-architecture/draft-ietf-mls-architecture.html).
//! It is used for end-to-end testing of OpenMLS and can be used by other
//! implementations. However it should never be used in any sort of production
//! environment.
//!
//! Because the infrastructure description doesn't give a lot of guidelines on
//! the design of the DS we take a couple of deliberate design decisions here:
//! * The DS does not know about groups.
//! * Clients have to send a list of clients (group members) along with each
//!   message for the DS to know where to send the message.
//! * The DS stores and delivers key packages.
//!
//! This is a very basic delivery service that allows to register clients and
//! send messages to MLS groups.
//! Note that there are a lot of limitations to this service:
//! * No persistence layer such that all information gets lost when the process
//!   shuts down.
//! * No authentication for clients.
//! * Key packages can't be updated, changed or deleted at the moment.
//! * Messages lost in transit are gone.
//!
//! **⚠️ DON'T EXPECT ANY SECURITY OR PRIVACY FROM THIS!**
//!
//! The server always listens on localhost and should be run behind a TLS server
//! if accessible on the public internet.
//!
//! The DS returns a list of messages queued for the client in all groups they
//! are part of.
